### Dev Process üí≠

Hello, I'm Dea. I build this project to practice frontend dev wokflows and create project documentation.

</div>
<div align="left"> 
    
#### Big Steps of the Journey üß©
  
1. **UI design**

    Since I care about how to manage this project organized and well-structured, I started by design the UI first. I also created the guideline to cover this project's need, such as colors, typography, margin, and all the components I used like, card, navbar, etc.

    I write about how I designed the UI and uploaded it on Dribbble, feel free to check it on ... (I excited to hear any suggestions from you <3)

2. **Design Into Code**

   I use **Vite** to boost the dev and bundling speed, **React** to help the UI building process, and **Tailwind CSS** to help the styling and maintain responsiveness faster. In the process, I follow the UI guidelines, create components based on design, create structured layout to ensure consistency and reusability, and I also store data in array-of-object form to maintain the scalability of information, such as products info, etc.

   And not to forget that I also use **built-in and custom hooks**. For example, `useState` (need it very much in many conditions, one of them is to manage Loading states), `useInView` to trigger motion when component enters viewport, `useMeasure` to measure viewport size when Tailwind CSS responsiveness couldnt, `useEffect` & `useLayoutEffect` to watch changes condition, also `useMemo` to memoize values. For the custom hooks, I mostly create them for motion related.

3. **Add Motion**

   For motion, i use **React Spring** since it recommended for a small bundle size. I want to keep this project light because I considering the project continuity (I think there is so many features I could implement later), so I dont really want to burden the performance.

4. **Care about Performance**

   Performance test is always a part of my journey remembering on how important it is. I strive to keep the performance at the good state as recommendation. For this project, I keep LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1 and INP < 200. To achieve that, I compress image file and change the format to WEBP/AVIF, minimize heavy motion, set preload or lazy load images, and set fetch priority to enhance LCP. As I change default font, I also set font to _swap_ mode to prevent rendering delay.

5. **Add a little touch of SEO**

   Yes, I include ü§è meta descriptions and keywords just to make sure I dont miss out of them...

#### Chalenge for Improvement üìà

1. Explore more state management to expose inspiration or new method for future plan
2. Expand testing process to enhance project quality
3. Dive deeper into motion libraries (since the process is a little depressing due to unfamiliar way of work)
4. Learn more about how to enhance performance
5. Improve time management (balancing job but still manage to involve in this career path and being excited to welcome new opportunities)
