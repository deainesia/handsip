      "Sometimes, after a long day, I sit on the floor, lean against the wall, and drink warm water from a cup that's a little worn out.",
      "It wasn't loud. It wasn't trying to impress. But it's the most honest moment of my day.",

      "The clink of spoons, the gentle steam from our drinks, and sometimes a soft laugh.",
      "And I've come to believe: Home doesn't need to be loud. It just needs to feel like you're where you're meant to be.",

      "Every morning, I hit play. Sometimes upbeat tracks, sometimes early 2000s pop. Then I make coffee.",
      "By the first sip, it's like someone pressed the “Start My Day” button in my brain.",
